# GIGNET — Cooperative Workforce & Service Network
**Smart India Hackathon SIH26089**

GIGNET connects households and community customers with certified, skilled gig workers organized under Labour Cooperative Societies and Federations. Built with an explainable multi-criteria allocation engine, progressive geospatial search, and demand forecasting.

## ⚡ Key Architectural Features

### 1. Multi-Criteria Allocation Engine
- **Hard Gate**: Skill match, verified KYC (`VERIFIED`), active status, and the **Ravi/Kumar Dynamic Slack Rule**:
  $$\text{slack} = \text{minutesUntilConfirmed} - (\text{emergencyDuration} + \text{travelToEmergency} + \text{travelBackToConfirmed})$$
  Excludes candidate only if $\text{slack} < 10\text{ min}$ safety buffer.
- **Progressive Geo Search**:
  - Scheduled: `2km → 5km → 10km → 15km`
  - Emergency: `3km → 6km → 12km → 15km`
- **Scheduled Formula (Fairness & Low Workload Dominates)**:
  $$\text{compositeScore} = 0.6 \times \text{utilizationScore} + 0.2 \times \text{ratingScore} + 0.2 \times \text{distanceScore}$$
  $$\text{finalScore} = \text{compositeScore} + (\text{isSameCooperative} ? 0.08 : 0)$$
- **Emergency Formula (Speed & Proximity Dominates)**:
  $$\text{finalScore} = 0.7 \times \text{distanceScore} + 0.2 \times \text{ratingScore} + 0.1 \times \text{utilizationScore}$$
- **Offer System**: 45-second animated countdown timer with automatic cascading to the next candidate on decline or timeout.

### 2. Cooperative Financial Split
- **80% Direct Worker Payout**: Zero predatory commissions.
- **15% Cooperative Welfare & Emergency Fund**: Transparent health, insurance, and tool grants.
- **5% Platform Infrastructure**: Tech maintenance.

## 🔐 Frontend Authentication

All three frontend applications now start behind a real login screen instead of silently switching to a demo persona. Authentication uses the existing backend OTP endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/auth/demo-otp/request` — request a demo OTP
- `POST /api/v1/auth/demo-otp/verify` — verify the OTP and receive a 7-day JWT
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me` — restore the session on refresh

**Demo OTP:** `123456`

Seeded demo accounts:

| App | Phone | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Customer | `+919876543210` | Customer / Asha |
| Worker | `+919876511111` | Worker / Suresh |
| Admin | `+919876500001` | Cooperative Admin |
| Admin | `+919876500002` | Federation Admin |

The login screen sends the phone number to the backend, verifies the OTP, stores the JWT in the correct app-specific local-storage key, and then opens the protected application.

> **Production warning:** the current OTP service is explicitly a demo adapter and returns the OTP in the API response. Replace it with a real SMS provider and rate limiting before deployment.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ (tested on Node v24)
- Python 3.10+ (tested on Python 3.14)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Seed Database
```bash
npm run seed
```
*Seeds Bangalore South & Indiranagar cooperatives, verified workers (Suresh - Balanced, Ramesh - Overloaded, Ravi - Schedule Conflict, Priya - Electrician), services, and initial 7-day forecast data.*

### 3. Start Backend & Microservices
```bash
# Terminal 1: Core Backend (Port 5000)
npm run dev:backend

# Terminal 2: Python Forecasting Microservice (Port 8000)
npm run forecast
```

### 4. Start Frontends
```bash
# Terminal 3: Customer App (Port 5173)
npm run dev:customer

# Terminal 4: Worker App (Port 5174)
npm run dev:worker

# Terminal 5: Admin App (Port 5175)
npm run dev:admin
```

## 💻 SIH 4-Laptop Evaluation Demo Walkthrough

1. **Laptop 1 (Customer App - Port 5173)**:
   - Select **Emergency Pipe Burst Repair** or **Scheduled Tap Installation**.
   - Click "Confirm & Find Verified Worker".
   - Watch the progressive radar search activate.

2. **Laptop 2 (Worker App - Port 5174)**:
   - Worker Suresh Kumar receives a **live 45-second countdown offer modal** with sound and visual alert.
   - Shows distance (2.1 km) and net take-home earnings (₹540).
   - Click **Accept Job** -> changes status to `CONFIRMED`.

3. **Laptop 1 & 2 (Live Tracking & Lifecycle Execution)**:
   - Worker clicks `[Start Trip]` -> simulated movement steps worker along coordinates towards customer.
   - Customer map shows real-time scooter marker moving with live ETA.
   - Worker clicks `[I Have Arrived]` -> `[Start Work]` -> `[Complete Work]`.
